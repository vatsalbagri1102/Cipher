Developed Cipher, a file encryption/decryption program using a variation of the Book Cipher algorithm.
Implemented algorithm consisting of per-byte bit manipulation and XOR encoding for a secure encryption and
decryption
Implemented C and ARM Assembly adaptations of the algorithm on a Raspberry Pi for performance optimization
and educational purposes
